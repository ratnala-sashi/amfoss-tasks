INTROSPECTION

a. Why must we choose you?

I was alwayscurious about coding.I had no idea what coding was.after the induction program i came to know what it mean.Being a noob for coding started my reasearch 'how to  
become a pro'. later on, we got tasks . if we complete then i can enter otherwise a normal cse guy. tried upto my level best by asking many of my friends and counsins. I wont 
say must u choose but i can say if u loose u me, u gave a chance to some other guy, to fill my space .. 

b. What is your plan for the next 6 six months?

i am not completeley familiar in coding . i have to strength up my concepts and skills with the help of great platform like amfoss. 

c. How would you contribute back to the club?

not repeating the same day. making the day new .

d. Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

ardous work - the word is enough to understand what i feel. i am from non cs background and these are like ordering me to swim in a ocean without knowing swimming. if it really 
happens without knowing how to swin but entering into ocean, for our life we will struggle right . the output is my tasks
