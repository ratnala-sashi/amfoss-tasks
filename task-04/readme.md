Debugging Derbies
not a easy one for me. After learning, i realized how simple it is . finally the code is ready

typos:
1)multiply was wrongly written as multipy

logical errors:
1)unit conversion (1ms=0.01s)

2)arithmetic operations are misplaced

3)correct answers are decremented by 1 or incremented by -1

4)similarly wrong answers was incremented by +23

5)start & stop buttons are placed in opposite positions

syntax errors:
1)missing semi-colons;

2)missing braces/brackets ()

3)extra comments //

I hope that there are no more errors left in this file and those comment lines are really helpful as u said in the document
